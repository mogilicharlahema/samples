    <p class="a4"><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was born on <strong>15 October 1931</strong>, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. 
        His father <u>Jainulabdeen Marakayar</u> was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
         His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
         Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. 
         His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
          Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. 
          The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. </p>
